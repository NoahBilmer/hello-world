        <h1 class="text-white">My Story</h1>
        <hr class="color-yellow">
        <p class="text-white">I begain programming on and off sometime in early 2020, ever since then, my passion for technology has only grown.
        In high school I was introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic" target="blank">Visual Basic</a>, which was where
        I learned many of the fundementals of programming.</p>
        <p class="text-white"> After high school I took a gap year to try to figure out what I'd like to study in college.
             I decided to challenge myself to the limit by enrolling in <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/">CS50</a>, and
             I genuinely think it's one of the best decision I've ever made, it sparked a love for programming in me that has not
             slowed down in the slightest.</p>
             <p class="text-white">Here at Algonquin College im continuing to challenge myself and learn a wide range of programming languages
                and technologies. Some of my favourite programming langauges to work with include...
             </p>
             <ul class="text-white">
                <li><span class="color-yellow">C</span> - I like how the language challenges us to really understand how algorithmns are built, with little hand holding.</li>
                <li><span class="color-yellow">Java</span> - I appreciate how explicit Java is, it forces us to think about the <i>structure</i> of our
                programs.</li>
                <li><span class="color-yellow">Python</span> - I like Python because it allows us to focus on the bigger picture of a program, and flesh out the details using
                    its many read-made tools.
